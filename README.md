## Explanation

# Contains
* Scraping scripts using phantom.js to get data from websites by storing html after the complete load of the pages.
* Script to parse html on the server side to extract interesting data into json files. (It's the exact oposite of what
 you do when you build web applications based on data.)
* Script to store data from json file in a database with a graphQL API. At a point json file was of course not what I wanted
in order to visualized all the datas, and to query specific data.

# Initial goal
I wanted to get datas about football player in order to start experimenting with Machine Learning. I expected to be able to
make prediction, at any level, just to understand ML and have fun with data in a sport I like.

Don't pay attention to the architecture of the project, it is not the result of any reflexion.
I just added stuff folling my needs.
